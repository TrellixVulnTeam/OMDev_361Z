NOTE: 
These are build with MSVC, so don't use the .dll from here to link
with MinGW based omc. Use the ones in ../../lib/mico-msys-mingw.

- debug version of MICO tools + dll is in:
  debug-version-of-mico+tool/debug.zip

- mico-other-tools-UNPACK-if-needed.zip
  contains the other mico tools like the naming service,
  etc. Not needed for omc compilation. just
  idl.exe + idl2311.dll and mico-cpp.exe and mico2311.dll
  are needed.
